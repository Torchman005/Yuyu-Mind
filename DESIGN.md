# Yuyu-Mind2 Design System

## Overview

### Creative North Star

Yuyu-Mind2 should feel like a soft glass desktop companion shell: gentle anime character energy, translucent panels, and clear local-agent controls. The interface can be playful, but it must never hide task state, approvals, logs, or model errors.

### Product Context And Register

- **Audience and primary job:** A developer/operator chats with Yuyu, manages local model services, reviews agent work, and checks plugins/tasks/logs in a Wails desktop shell.
- **Target markets and evidence:** The current product copy is Chinese and the repository describes a personal desktop companion. No Japan-specific market or regulated commerce flow is in scope.
- **Locale and language policy:** Owned UI copy is Simplified Chinese with technical identifiers left in English when they are literal API/plugin/status names.
- **Usage scene:** Desktop-first, repeated during coding or content creation, with occasional transparent pet mode overlaying the desktop.
- **Register:** Hybrid. Chat and Live2D surfaces carry expressive brand personality; plugins, tasks, settings, and logs stay product-dense and scannable.
- **Memorable signature:** Frosted-glass companion panels: translucent surfaces, subtle reflected highlights, and low-saturation status chips tied to Yuyu's modes.
- **Restraint:** Keep code review, logs, config, and task approvals quiet, high-contrast, and spatially stable.
- **Anti-references:** Avoid all-black IDE skins, single-hue blue dashboards, beige editorial landing pages, and decorative anime clichés that reduce legibility.
- **Token ownership/runtime mapping:** Existing runtime CSS variables in `frontend/src/App.css` remain canonical. This file mirrors accepted durable tokens and explains their roles.

## Colors

The default application theme is light, low-saturation, and glassy. `background` is a warm near-white and `surfaceSoft` a faint rose-grey, so the shell never reads as candy; `primary` is a muted rose (`#B06E93`) reserved for brand/action emphasis, `primaryStrong` for the pressed/active text tone; `secondary` is a desaturated slate blue for information and navigation; `mint`, `success`, `warning`, and `danger` stay semantic and equally low-saturation. Text is a graphite-aubergine instead of pure black for softer contrast without losing readability.

Two rules keep the shell from feeling noisy: **no decorative background patterns** (gradients only carry depth, never texture), and **shadows are neutral** — depth comes from layered neutral shadows (`--shadow`, `--shadow-soft`, `--shadow-lift`), not from coloured glows. All colour values live in the token layer (`:root` / `.app-shell.web`); components must reference tokens rather than hard-coding rgba values.

## Typography

Nunito is already bundled and remains the body/display face because its rounded forms match the desktop-pet identity. Chinese text falls through to Segoe UI and system CJK fonts. Monospace areas use Cascadia Mono/JetBrains Mono/Consolas for logs, diffs, and config.

## Layout

The desktop detail mode uses a fixed sidebar plus one flexible content pane. Chat and log feeds own their own scroll regions; forms and settings keep natural document scrolling. Pet mode remains transparent and minimal, with controls outside the Live2D hit area.

## Elevation & Depth

Depth comes from translucent surfaces, backdrop blur, reflected top edges, and restrained shadows. Static utility panels use glass borders; important interactive cards may lift slightly on hover. Dark code/diff surfaces are allowed only for technical text blocks where syntax contrast matters.

## Shapes

Controls use pill radius when they are short actions or chips. Panels and cards use 12–16px radii; dense log rows and diff rows use 8px. Nested cards should be avoided unless the inner surface represents a separate repeated object.

## Components

### Foundational Visual States

Every button has hover, focus-visible, active/pressed, disabled, and busy-stable geometry. Scrollbars inherit a global themed baseline. Textareas are not manually resizable; long content scrolls internally.

### Buttons And Actions

Brand actions use `primary`; neutral actions use white or soft surfaces; destructive actions use `danger` and remain visually separated from routine controls. Icon-like labels may be used only when the symbol is already familiar in this product.

### Navigation And Data Display

Sidebar navigation uses colored active state plus shape, not color alone. Cards in plugins/tasks expose name, status, and next action without depending on hover-only affordances. Code review lists preserve filenames in monospace and allow full paths through wrapping or ellipsis.

### Forms And Overlays

Configuration editors use fixed-height textareas with internal scrolling. Native select is acceptable for the logs level filter because platform-owned popup geometry is not business-critical. Errors are inline, persistent, and specific.

### Iconography

No external icon set is installed. Use concise glyphs or text labels already present in the app; do not introduce a second icon language unless an icon package is deliberately adopted later.

### Motion

Motion is small, consistent, and stateful: hover lift (`translateY(-1px)` on controls, `-2px` on cards), active press (`scale(0.985)`), and Live2D presence. Timing comes from the shared motion tokens — `--dur-fast` 120ms for press feedback, `--dur` 180ms for colour/border, `--dur-slow` 260ms for card lift — with `--ease`/`--ease-out` as the only easings. Animate only `transform`, `opacity`, `box-shadow`, and colour so motion stays GPU-friendly and never triggers layout. Respect reduced motion by disabling decorative transitions and animations outside the avatar's own rendering.

### Character Expression Layers

The room stage carries two independent expression channels and they must never look alike:

- **Spoken line** (`room-speech-bubble`): a solid white card, bold weight, centred, with a soft shadow. High presence — it is something the character actually says, and it is also spoken aloud by TTS.
- **Inner monologue** (`room-thought`, "心声"): a **dashed-border ghost pill**, italic, muted colour, no shadow, smaller type, with a leading `⋯` glyph. Low presence — it is deliberately *not* spoken aloud and never becomes a chat message.

The contrast is the message: if the inner voice were rendered as another speech bubble, the user would read it as a second line of dialogue and the effect inverts. The two channels also sit in different places — the spoken line is anchored at the top of the stage, the inner voice in the lower middle, above the status island band — so they never compete for the same space. Inner monologue fades in, holds, then drifts upward as it fades out, as though the thought disperses by itself.

### Content And Data Visualization

UI copy is friendly Simplified Chinese, direct, and task-oriented. Model/plugin/status identifiers may remain literal English for debugging accuracy.

## Do's And Don'ts

- **Do:** Use low-saturation accents to clarify mood, status, and navigation.
- **Do:** Preserve glass clarity with blur, reflected edges, and readable contrast.
- **Do:** Keep task approvals, logs, and code review layouts stable while data changes.
- **Do:** Keep the spoken line and the inner monologue as two distinct visual languages (solid vs dashed ghost).
- **Don't:** Return the web tool pages to a mostly black theme.
- **Don't:** Use rainbow/candy copy or overly saturated gradients for routine app chrome.
- **Don't:** Render inner monologue as another speech bubble, or route it into TTS — it must stay unspoken.
- **Don't:** Hide scrollbars, use browser dialogs, or make non-button elements responsible for core actions.
